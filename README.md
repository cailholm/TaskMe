About extension:
===============

This extension adds sampled task monitoring feature to your calendar. 

It is Your activity logger.

It periodically displays window with textbox where You can put your description of currently performed tasks.
Task Me extension will create event with your description in chosen calendar.

By default activity logger is deactivated. To activate it, configure it first in extension's settings.

First sentence will be treated as event's title. Submitting a description without a change 
will extend the event in Your calendar instead of creating new event.
